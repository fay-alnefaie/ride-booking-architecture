# Ride-Booking Mobile Application Architecture

This repository contains the architectural design and system components for a ride-booking mobile application, built as part of the Software Design & Construction II course project.

## Project Overview

The system connects passengers with nearby drivers, handling ride requests, confirmations, payments, and location tracking. The architecture supports secure, modular, and scalable design for real-time transportation services.

## Key Components

- *User Apps (Driver & Rider):* UI/UX for ride requests, status updates, and payments.
- *Web Services:* API gateway for data flow, user authentication, and service coordination.
- *Backend Services:* Authentication, Ride Management, Notifications, and Payment Service.
- *Payment Gateway:* Secure third-party API for transaction processing.
- *Google Maps API:* Location tracking and navigation for drivers.
- *Data Storage:* User data, ride history, payment records, and analytics.
